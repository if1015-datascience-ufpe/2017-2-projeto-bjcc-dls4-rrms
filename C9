276;2017-10-18 18:26:24;I fw c9 cus NA and most of the players they seem to pick up have a cool personality whilst being one of the best. Atleast w csGo/melee imo
277;2017-10-18 18:26:08;The C9 2018 uniform is looking good https:// twitter.com/c9sneaky/statu s/920187042532769797 …
278;2017-10-18 18:22:05;https://www. reddit.com/r/leagueoflege nds/comments/777wls/every_imt_player_went_vocal_at_twitter/dojt15n/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=leagueoflegends … this. granted C9 are doing the same thing but at least its not in LA i guess
279;2017-10-18 18:21:59;Then clearly you don't face chogaths often. Shits broken
280;2017-10-18 18:17:01;that's not confirmed otherwise why would Optic or C9 be in LCS? https:// youtu.be/UZIQJawPNmM
281;2017-10-18 18:15:23;teams. Optic will be no different. shit it might be even greater. if they put the effort in like TL / C9 / TSM do they'll have
282;2017-10-18 18:08:56;@c9 _meteos Why you no play Donkey Kong?
283;2017-10-18 18:08:04;i DO rock my HTC10(horridBatteryLife), hopefully C9 lasts longer than my htcbatterylife...
284;2017-10-18 18:06:46;The whole franchising thing has confused me. All my fav teams are getting kicked out. C9 is the last team left that I love :(
285;2017-10-18 18:03:56;But if I am not mistaken, C9 for example is in both. The are in OWLeague London and haf already secured their lcs spot with a 32 mill deal
286;2017-10-18 17:58:57;That would be epic...I think C9 would end up with the same roster... https:// twitter.com/FionnOnFire/st atus/920702075478183936 …
287;2017-10-18 17:57:04;I would say TSM, Tempo Storm, C9 and Immortals. TSM Bjergsen, Tempo Storm Quas, C9 Sneaky and Immortals flame for players, then managment!
288;2017-10-18 17:55:20;Only surviving teams are TSM, C9 , TL, and CLG Wow
289;2017-10-18 17:49:33;remove C9 and OpTic
290;2017-10-18 17:49:24;C9 and cause of their League team
291;2017-10-18 17:45:47;Had the weirdest god damn dream... I joined C9 as their support and we went on a camping trip???? OKAY BRAIN.
292;2017-10-18 17:45:36;Dude, I totally miss you
293;2017-10-18 17:37:59;They resemble each other so much https:// twitter.com/johnnyxwhack/s tatus/920749515656847360 …
294;2017-10-18 17:36:29;If that were the case they wouldn't have let c9 in
295;2017-10-18 17:34:42;Light drives out the dark pic.twitter.com/Q4Yv4kYKNw
296;2017-10-18 17:30:51;"""Literally everyone"" you sound so stupid lmao no it's not C9 is number two"
297;2017-10-18 17:28:33;Its the fact that early game matters very little, assassins are weak, tanks AND botlane are op, and comp matters more than competency
298;2017-10-18 17:28:21;My two favorite teams are C9 and SKT because they were the NA representative and winners of LOL All-Stars 2014, first tourney I watched
299;2017-10-18 17:28:06;All these articles are some scary stuff for the NALCS. I mean, I love TSM and C9 , but kicking out everyone under the sun seems extreme
